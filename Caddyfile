# Put your EC2 Public IP here, or better, your custom domain if you have one.
# For direct IP usage (which cannot have Let's Encrypt), Caddy uses self-signed by default.
# HOWEVER, for Vercel Mixed Content, you typically need a REAL domain for valid SSL.
# For quick testing with IP, we can use HTTP but Vercel forces HTTPS.

# OPTION 1: Using nio.io (wildcard DNS for IP addresses) to get valid SSL
# e.g. 54.123.45.67.nip.io
# Replace 3.6.224.83 with your actual IP

3.6.224.83.nip.io {
